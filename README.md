## Projects

ArBC was the first big project wich I got into. His purpose is help kids to associate words to real world objects.
To build it,with all eight members understanding it's project dynamic, we had to use a lot of principles of Scrum
and Agile, like: sprint review, sprint planning, dailys, burn down graph (based on planning poker of issues),
XP (extreme programming), tests, etc. And of course my git knowledge after that grow a lot.
