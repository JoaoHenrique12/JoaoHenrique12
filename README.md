## Projects

### [Naruto Fandom Scraping](https://github.com/JoaoHenrique12/naruto_fandom_scraping)

<p align="justify" >
Is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping">web scrapper</a> to gather data from 
<a href="https://naruto.fandom.com/pt-br/wiki/Categoria:Ninjutsu">Naruto fandom pt-BR</a> and 
store it into a postgres database. 
The integration of web scraping, PostgreSQL, <a href="https://github.com/schemaspy/schemaspy">schemaspy</a>,
and <a href="https://www.pgadmin.org/">pgAdmin</a> formed a comprehensive workflow for data retrieval, storage,
and database management. 
By the way, almost all code present in this project was developed using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">TDD</a>.

### [WikiBook](https://github.com/JoaoHenrique12/WikiBook)
<p align="justify">
The initial idea was to build a social network for individuals who read Wikipedia articles. The 'algorithm' would connect people with similar interests in articles. Therefore, a module of the project would involve a program to extract metadata from a series of Wikipedia pages. These metadata would assist in matching users within the social network.

<p align="justify">
WikiBook is an unfinished project, but it has some noteworthy features: User Authentication, Django Signals, Selenium and Factory Boy for test creation.

<p align="justify">
ArBC was the first big project wich I got into. His purpose is help kids to associate words to real world objects.
To build it,with all eight members understanding it's project dynamic, we had to use a lot of principles of Scrum
and Agile, like: sprint review, sprint planning, dailys, burn down graph (based on planning poker of issues),
XP (extreme programming), tests, etc. And of course my git knowledge after that grow a lot.
