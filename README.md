### [Naruto Fandom Scraping](https://github.com/JoaoHenrique12/naruto_fandom_scraping)

<p align="justify" >
Is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping">web scrapper</a> to gather data from 
<a href="https://naruto.fandom.com/pt-br/wiki/Categoria:Ninjutsu">Naruto fandom pt-BR</a> and 
store it into a postgres database. 
The integration of web scraping, PostgreSQL, <a href="https://github.com/schemaspy/schemaspy">schemaspy</a>,
and <a href="https://www.pgadmin.org/">pgAdmin</a> formed a comprehensive workflow for data retrieval, storage,
and database management. 
By the way, almost all code present in this project was developed using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">TDD</a>.

Into college I frequentate some classes about algorithm projects, learned a lot about Graphs,
and build a project inspired in [Kevin Bacon's problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Degrees_of_Kevin_Bacon).

ArBC was the first big project wich I got into. His purpose is help kids to associate words to real world objects.
To build it,with all eight members understanding it's project dynamic, we had to use a lot of principles of Scrum
and Agile, like: sprint review, sprint planning, dailys, burn down graph (based on planning poker of issues),
XP (extreme programming), tests, etc. And of course my git knowledge after that grow a lot.
