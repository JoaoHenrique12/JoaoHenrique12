### About my english

I had some classes with professor 
[Joel Saint Anna](https://www.google.com/search?q=joel+santana+falando+ingl%C3%AAs&oq=joel&aqs=chrome.2.69i57j46i131i433i512j69i59j0i67j46i67i433j46i67l3j0i131i433i512j46i433i512.3217j1j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#fpstate=ive&vld=cid:bff6703a,vid:BoxA9ghHkOM), 
I can't speak a lot but can handle technical documentation about Django, CPP and any other theme about software development.


## Projects

### [Mastering Frontend](https://github.com/JoaoHenrique12/mastering_frontend)

When my interior designer comes out I use this repository.

- Frontend
- Designer Skills

### [CS:GO connections](https://github.com/projeto-de-algoritmos/Grafos1_csgo_connections)

Into college I frequentate some classes about algorithm projects, learned a lot about Graphs,
and build a progect inspired in [Kevin Bacon's problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Degrees_of_Kevin_Bacon).
The main difference in my project is: I used CS:GO players and scrapped data from [hltv](https://www.hltv.org/).

- Pythonic
- Coding
- Backend
