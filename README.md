### About my english

I had some classes with professor 
[Joel Saint Anna](https://www.google.com/search?q=joel+santana+falando+ingl%C3%AAs&oq=joel&aqs=chrome.2.69i57j46i131i433i512j69i59j0i67j46i67i433j46i67l3j0i131i433i512j46i433i512.3217j1j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#fpstate=ive&vld=cid:bff6703a,vid:BoxA9ghHkOM), 
I can't speak a lot but can handle technical documentation about Django, CPP and any other theme about software development.


## Projects

### [ArBC](https://github.com/fga-eps-mds/2019.2-ArBC)

ArBC was the first big project wich I got into. His purpose is help kids to associate words to real world objects.
To build it,with all eight members understanding it's project dynamic, we had to use a lot of principles of Scrum
and Agile, like: sprint review, sprint planning, dailys, burn down graph (based on planning poker of issues),
XP (extreme programming), tests, etc. And of course my git knowledge after that grow a lot.

- Agile
- Programming Languages
- Frontend
- Backend

### [CS:GO connections](https://github.com/projeto-de-algoritmos/Grafos1_csgo_connections)

Into college I frequentate some classes about algorithm projects, learned a lot about Graphs,
and build a project inspired in [Kevin Bacon's problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Degrees_of_Kevin_Bacon).
The main difference in my project is: I used CS:GO players and scrapped data from [hltv](https://www.hltv.org/).

- Pythonic
- Coding
- Backend

### [Mastering Frontend](https://github.com/JoaoHenrique12/mastering_frontend)

When my interior designer comes out I use this repository.
